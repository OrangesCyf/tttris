    <string name="donate1">Probably you should not. Surely this game doesnt seem very exciting, or maybe you thought, "Oh, it's a good idea, but still has a long way to go." A small donation is a good incentive to go down that road. I have spent many hours on this, and I have so many more to invest, and I would like it to be profitable enough to take a couple of cups of coffee</string>
    <string name="donate2">Thank you!</string>
